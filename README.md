## The Bat-Coder

Hello! I am Ted Jablonowski, and this small portfolio website I made will hopefully be the start of something special. I am currently enrolled in MSU and have started my journey! I call myself the "Bat-Coder" because I'm a huge Batman fan (quite obviously) and want any prospective employers and any who may need my services to know that they are hiring an individual with passions and interests!
