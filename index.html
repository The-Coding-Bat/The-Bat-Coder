                <br>
                <br>
                
                <p>I was born on August 18th, 1990. An avid gamer, I grew up on Zelda and was inspired by that and similiar forms of media at a young age. I've always strived to be great at what I do. A self-motivator, I have been promoted in several different jobs, been seen as a leader, and always look out for those around me. With coding, I'm diving into a whole new world and find that I'm legitimately enjoying myself, and intend to make the absolute most of this new opportunity!
                    
                    <br>
                    <br>

                   I'm married and have 2 amazing children, whom I care about more than anything and would give everything for. I have a pretty impressive collection Zelda and Batman merchandise. My favorite movies are the Lord of the Rings saga and my favorite book is Bram Stoker's Dracula. I'm also an old school wrestling fan!

                   <br>
                   <br>

                    I'm a had working and dedicated individual. Loyal and caring. Ultimately, all I want is to work for a company I can trust, that will help me to make care of my family. In the end, I can't ask for anthing more than that!
